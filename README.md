01.Problem: Numbers from 1 to 100
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. The program does not accept input and prints 
the numbers from 1 to 100 sequentially, each on a separate line.
Hints and Guidelines
We can solve the problem using a for loop, via which we will pass through the numbers from 1 to 
100 using the i variable, and print the numbers in the body of the loop.

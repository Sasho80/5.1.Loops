01.Problem: Numbers from 1 to 100
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. The program does not accept input and prints 
the numbers from 1 to 100 sequentially, each on a separate line.
Hints and Guidelines
We can solve the problem using a for loop, via which we will pass through the numbers from 1 to 
100 using the i variable, and print the numbers in the body of the loop.

02.Example: Numbers up to 1000, Ending by 7
Write a program that finds all numbers within the range [1 … 1000] that end in 7.
Hints and Guidelines
We can solve the problem by combining a for loop for passing through the numbers from 1 to 1000 
and a condition to check if each of the numbers ends in 7. Of course, there are other solutions too, 
but let's solve the problem using a loop + condition.

03.Example: All Latin Letters
Write a program that prints the letters of the English Alphabet: a, b, c, …, z.
Hints and Guidelines
It is good to know that the for loops don't only work with numbers. We can solve the task by running 
a for loop that passes sequentially through all letters in the English alphabet.

04.Problem: Summing up Numbers
Write a program that inputs n integers and sums them up.
• The first line of the input holds the number of integers n.
• Each of the following n lines holds an integer for summing.
• Sum up the numbers and finally print the result.
Sample Input and Output
Input Output Input Output Input Output Input Output Input Output 
2     30     3     -60    4     43     1     999    0     0
10           -10          45           999
20           -20         -20
             -30          7
                          11
